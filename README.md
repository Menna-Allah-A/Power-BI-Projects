## Problem Statement

This dashboard addresses the need for a clear and concise understanding of population data across the United States. By presenting population figures by state and region, as well as historical trends, it provides valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and the general public. The goal is to highlight variations in population growth, regional demographics, and the overall distribution of the population.

### Steps Followed
- Data Import : Loaded CSV files containing population data into Power BI.

- Data Transformation: Utilized Power Query to clean and transform the data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

- Census Region Mapping: Created a map visual that displays states grouped by census regions (Midwest, Northeast, South, West).

- Population Table: Developed a table showing each state, its abbreviation, census division, region, and the total population based on 2015 data.

- Bar Chart Creation: Added a bar chart to visualize the count of states in each census region, making it easy to compare regional distributions. 

- Historical Population Trends: Created a line graph illustrating the population of the U.S. from 1950 to 2015, showcasing growth trends over time.

- Interactive Features: Incorporated slicers to filter data by census region, allowing for dynamic analysis based on user selection.

- Tooltips and Annotations: Added tooltips to provide additional context for the graphs, enhancing user understanding of the data.

## Insights

* Population Distribution: The map visualization clearly delineates the states into their respective census regions, revealing the geographical distribution of the population.

- Regional Comparison: The bar chart shows the number of states in each census region, highlighting that the South has a significant representation compared to other regions.

- Growth Trends: The line graph illustrates a steady increase in the U.S. population from 150 million in 1950 to over 300 million by 2015, indicating robust population growth over the decades.
